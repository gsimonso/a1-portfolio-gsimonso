    <!-- <a href="#">Link Here</a></li> -->
    <p class="description">Open Project Space (OPS) is a year-long technical course in embedded systems. We introduce engineering students to topics relevant to their coursework and potential career paths: integrated circuits, breadboarding, soldering, microcontrollers, embedded programming with C++, PCB design, and hardware communication. Unlike a traditional college course, we aim to increase engagement with project-based learning. Students individually complete eight projects encapsulating the program’s topics, culminating in one final capstone project where they design and build a remote-controlled rover. Regularly scheduled workshops and lectures complement the projects.</p>
