--Readme document for Genevieve Simonson, gsimonso@uci.edu--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

9/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 1/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
 1. an image with descripitve alternative attributes
 2. headings and paragraph text
 3. links to external pages
 4. multiple pages with navigation between them


(b) CSS features
 1. modify padding and margins
 2. modify link text color/other colors
 3. custom fonts


(c) Advanced features
 1. embedded media
 2. contact form


3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.

I chose to ignore the warning about header nesting in the index.html accessibility check because I wanted the header sections for each resume section to be the same size and H2 was too big.
The other warnings I chose to ignore was in the hobbies page due to the Instagram embed that I copied directly from Instagram embed option.


4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

Around 16 hours in total


5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)

Consulted this video for ideas on the general website design process: https://youtu.be/_tWh4cYCTv0?si=qRNJJ7JAx1LWjtnh
Consulted W3 HTML Tutorial for examples of basic HTML syntax: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp
Referenced this video for how to create a basic navigation bar: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Yw9gBHE60E

6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?

No other classmates were consulted during the assignment.


7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?

For the Instagram and Youtube links to show the content you need to run using http/https on localhost.
Run pythom -m http.server and visit http://localhost:8000 on your broswer
